#dl_baseline: code for the deep learning baseline
#To run the code: run dl_baseline.ipynb

#non_dl_baseline: code for the non-deep learning basline
#To run the code: run non_dl_baseline.ipynb, run each cell from top to bottom


#adv_dl_model: code for the advanced deep learning model
#To run the code: run AdvancedModels.ipynb, run each cell from top to bottom, each model is in thier own training loop
